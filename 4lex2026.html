                <h2>Full Steam Ahead</h2>
                <p>Last year on Valentine&apos;s day, we had only been married for four months. Now we are well on our way to two years. Isn&apos;t it odd that time feel fast and slow at the same time? It&apos;s like we've been married for a decade, but also it seems like I was just sitting down to write this page for last year mere moments ago.</p>
                <p>The one thing that this last year has made me sure of is that we are definitely going to be together forever. With all the intensity and insanity of the last twelve months put together, a couple with a weak bond would have struggled, but for us it was hardly a challenge at all. Every hardship we endure together, far from being a source of contention, is like another flower in the garden of memories we are planting together.</p>
                <p>How much more is it possible to love one person? We haven&apos;t found it yet, but I can&apos;t wait to spend another year trying to find the limit with you.</p>

                <h2>Potatoes and So On</h2>
                <p>A few months ago we drove for five days across the entire country so that we could come to the Potato Kingdom. Leaving Florida actually wasn&apos;t that scary for me, believe it or not, even though I was leaving behind my family and friends and pretty much everything I knew. The reason, obviously, is that I was moving with you. Wherever I end up, as long as I have you by my side, I know that it&apos;ll feel like home.</p>
                <p>But for future posterity, because I hope that our children will be reading this one day, try to avoid cross-country moving with rabbits in the back. Not as fun as you might expect! Can you believe that last year when I wrote this we didn't have Pickles yet? Chalupa would not have enjoyed making that trip alone.</p>
